# README
URL Shortener is a service that takes long URLs and squeezes them into fewer characters to make a link that is easier to share, tweet, or email to friends. Users can create these short links through the web interface.

Links that users create through the URL Shortener can also open directly in your mobile applications that can handle those links. This automatic behavior provides the best possible experience to your app users who open goo.gl links, no matter what platform or device they are on.
